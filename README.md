# space_for_thought

Space for Thought has been designed as a portable NASA APOD viewing application, essentially an app for fans of astrology.

This project was created to compete in the 2018 Flutter Create competition, that being to create an application in under 5KB of dart code.

The project is not clean; but works. I managed to reduce the file size my mostly compressing the code structure, which in turn has impaired its readability.
